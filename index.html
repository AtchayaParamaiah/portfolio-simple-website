            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">Atchaya is a 21-year-old computer science student at Hillsborough Community
                College, driven by a passion for
                math, coding, and technology. With a long-term goal of becoming a top-level software engineer or even a
                CTO,
                she
                is committed to building a strong foundation through continuous learning and skill development. She has
                completed professional certifications in Data Analytics and Project Management and is currently focused
                on
                mastering Python through the “Python for Everybody” course on freeCodeCamp, with plans to practice
                regularly
                on
                HackerRank. Atchaya has two years of customer service experience and freelance project management work,
                which
                sharpened her communication and organizational skills. Beyond academics, she is dedicated to achieving
                financial
                independence, building a flexible lifestyle, and helping those in need. She also has entrepreneurial
                aspirations, including opening a henna business in the U.S. Her thoughtful approach extends to skincare
                and
                personal growth, and she values clarity, motivation, and engagement in both learning and life.</p>
